        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine 1 teaspoon salt per pound of beef, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and granulated garlic in a small bowl and mix well. Set the beef on a piece of butcher paper, and apply half of salt mixture evenly to each side, tamping it on lightly with a fork. Press the sides of the roast onto any seasoning that has fallen onto the paper. Place beef on a wire rack set over a pan. Refrigerate the “dry brined” beef, uncovered, for 24 hours, turning meat over once after 12 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Heat oil in an oven-safe pan or skillet over high heat; add beef to pan and sear on both sides until nicely browned, about 3 minutes per side. Using tongs, pick up the meat and sear on the sides as well, if desired.</li>
                <li>Turn off heat and add onions to the pan wherever they fit; top with mushrooms. Season vegetables with the 1/2 teaspoon salt. Drizzle melted butter over vegetables, and brush melted butter over beef.</li>
                <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C), and continue to roast beef until desired internal temperature is reached. Begin to check temperature after 15 to 20 minutes. For medium-rare, an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of beef should reach 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). For medium, internal temperature should reach 130 to 135 degrees F (54 to 57 degrees C). Total roasting time will depend on the size of the roast.</li>
                <li>Remove beef from the oven, transfer to a plate, and cover loosely with foil. Let rest at least 15 to 20 minutes before slicing.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare the gravy. Remove mushrooms from the pan, and keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>Melt 1 tablespoon cold butter in the pan over medium-high heat; sprinkle in flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Whisk in vinegar and beef broth, and bring mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne to taste, and add thyme leaves.</li>
                <li>Continue boiling on medium-high heat until gravy reduces by about half and thickens slightly. Gravy can be reduced more for a thicker texture.</li>
                <li>Once meat is rested, slice thinly at a 45-degree angle, and serve with mushrooms and hot gravy over the top.</li>
