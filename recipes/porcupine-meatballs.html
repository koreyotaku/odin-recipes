    <h3>Porcupine meatballs are ground beef-rice balls cooked in tomato sauce. The meatballs, a staple during the Great Depression because of the few ingredients required to make them, get their name from their appearance to porcupines (the rice makes the balls appear prickly).</h3>

    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but heres a brief overview of what you can expect when you make porcupine meatballs:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup uncooked long grain white rice</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup low sodium chicken stock, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix ground beef, rice, water, onion, salt, celery salt, garlic powder, and black pepper thoroughly in a bowl until well combined. Roll mixture into 12 meatballs.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place meatballs into the hot skillet; cook, turning once halfway through cooking, until well browned, about 8 minutes. Drain and discard excess grease.</li>
        <li>Pour tomato sauce, chicken stock, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar into the skillet; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until meatballs are no longer pink in the center and rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Stir in more stock if sauce becomes too dry.</li>
